dogCheck <- function(height_cm) {
  if(height_cm < 112 & height_cm > 9){
    possible_dog <- TRUE
  } else {
    possible_dog <- FALSE
  }
  return(possible_dog)
}

### Advanced Task ###
# Use this shell, and fill in a bit of your own code. 
# Test to see if you can make it return the expected value.
# If you have time, explain your code to other group members.
